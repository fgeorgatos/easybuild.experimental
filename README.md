easybuild.experimental
======================

This git repo is a playground area for easybuild developers, as long as we all talk "Open Source" with unlimited redistribution.

**You can freely create a directory bearing your github name under ./users and work in it as you wish. Simply ask to be added as a collaborator**
Thousands of easyconfig files built in a bulk fashion may become available here, for example see under contrib/pkgsrc
Whatever you do, remember the words of this pal [http://www.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf]
